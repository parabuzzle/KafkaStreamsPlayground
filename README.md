KafkaStreamsPlayground
---

A simplified little example app for using kafka streams to sort messages for a real-world use case. If you're new to Kafka streams and you're Java is rusty... this example should get you far enough to start hacking your own stuff.

I have an example of a simple filter and a branch operation for message sorting within the streaming processor.
